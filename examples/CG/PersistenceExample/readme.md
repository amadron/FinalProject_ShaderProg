### How to save and load your game state
Make this example into a real [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) game that you can leave and continue.

1. Try out what you can do in the "game" with the mouse by clicking left, right or middle button in the grid
1. End the program and start it again. Your game state should be restored
1. Switch the visuals. There is a very simple one that draws to the console for debugging.
1. Hit the `r`-key your game should reset
1. Switch to a 3x3 game board
1. Add a game logic class and implement the Tic-Tac-Toe logic for two human players:
*Two players, X and O, take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid. 
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.*
1. Generalize your logic to work with arbitrary board sizes
1. Make the graphics nicer (textures, ...)
